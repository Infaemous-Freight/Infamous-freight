## 🔧 DEPLOYMENT STEPS (IN ORDER)

### STEP 1: Final Verification (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /workspaces/Infamous-freight-enterprises

# Verify all requirements complete
echo "✅ Pre-flight checklist"
echo "✅ Environment file: .env.production"
echo "✅ Database backup created and verified"
echo "✅ Stakeholder approvals obtained"
echo "✅ On-call coverage confirmed"
echo "✅ Team notifications sent"

# Run final system check
bash scripts/pre-deployment-check.sh
```

**Expected Result**: All checks PASS ✅

---

### STEP 2: Create Fresh Backup (3 minutes)

```bash
# Create backup immediately before deployment
BACKUP_FILE="backup_pre-deployment_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql"
pg_dump -h localhost -U postgres -d infamous_freight > "$BACKUP_FILE"

# Verify
ls -lh "$BACKUP_FILE"
echo "Backup ready at: $(pwd)/$BACKUP_FILE"

# Mark location
echo "$BACKUP_FILE" > .backup-location
```

---

### STEP 3: Deploy Production (10 minutes)

**Option A: Using Deploy Script (Recommended)**

```bash
# Execute automated deployment script
bash scripts/deploy-production.sh

# Monitor output:
# [OK] Dependencies installed
# [OK] Tests passed
# [OK] Build successful
# [OK] Database migrated
# [OK] Security audit passed
# [OK] Services started
```

**Option B: Using Docker Compose**

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# Monitor startup
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f

# Expected: All 7 services running
# - nginx (reverse proxy)
# - api (2 instances)
# - web (frontend)
# - postgres (database)
# - redis (cache)
# - prometheus (metrics)
# - grafana (dashboard)
```

---

### STEP 4: Health Verification (5 minutes)

```bash
# Wait for services to stabilize (30 seconds)
sleep 30

# Check API health
curl -v http://localhost:3001/api/health

# Expected response:
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# {
#   "uptime": 45.123,
#   "timestamp": 1704067200000,
#   "status": "ok",
#   "database": "connected",
#   "redis": "connected"
# }
```

**If health check fails**:

```bash
# Check service logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs api
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs postgres

# STOP and investigate before proceeding
```

---

### STEP 5: Smoke Tests (5 minutes)

```bash
# Test AI Dispatch Service
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/ai/dispatch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"loadId": "test-load-123"}'

# Test AI Coaching Service
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/drivers/123/coaching \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Check Grafana Dashboard
# Open: http://localhost:3002
# Login: admin / [YOUR_GRAFANA_PASSWORD]
# Verify: 9 dashboard panels showing data

# Check Prometheus
# Open: http://localhost:9090
# Query: up{job="api"}
# Expected: 2 API instances up
```

---

### STEP 6: Post-Deployment Validation (5 minutes)

```bash
# Verify all containers running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps
# Expected: 7 services, all "Up"

# Check logs for errors
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs | grep -i error

# Verify database connectivity
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml exec postgres \
  psql -U postgres -d infamous_freight -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shipments"

# Verify Redis connectivity
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml exec redis \
  redis-cli ping
# Expected: PONG
```

---

## 📊 MONITORING & ALERT VERIFICATION

### Immediate Checks (First 5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Error Rate (should be < 0.1%)
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query='rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])'

# 2. Response Time (p95 should be < 2s)
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query='histogram_quantile(0.95, http_request_duration_seconds)'

# 3. Active Connections (should be > 0)
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query='active_connections'

# 4. Database Connections (should be < max)
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query='pg_stat_activity_count'
```

### Dashboard Verification (Grafana)

1. Open http://localhost:3002
2. Login: admin / [YOUR_PASSWORD]
3. Navigate to API Dashboard
4. Verify all 9 panels:
   - ✅ Request rate > 0
   - ✅ Error rate < 1%
   - ✅ Response time p95 < 2s
   - ✅ Memory usage reasonable
   - ✅ CPU usage < 80%
   - ✅ Database connections stable
   - ✅ Redis connections active
   - ✅ AI services operating
   - ✅ Cache hit rate > 50%

---

## ⚠️ ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### Immediate Rollback (< 2 minutes)

**If critical issues detected**:

```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down

# Restore database from backup
pg_restore --dbname=infamous_freight < $(cat .backup-location)

# Verify restore successful
psql -U postgres -d infamous_freight -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shipments"

# Restart services with backup state
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# Verify health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

### Critical Issues Requiring Rollback

- ❌ Error rate > 5%
- ❌ Health endpoints not responding (status != 200)
- ❌ Database connection failed
- ❌ More than 1 service down
- ❌ Memory leak detected (growing continuously)
- ❌ Repeated fatal errors in logs

### Rollback Notification

```bash
# Notify team immediately
echo "🚨 PRODUCTION ROLLBACK EXECUTED

Service: Infamous Freight Enterprises
Reason: [INSERT REASON]
Executed: $(date)
Duration: ~15 minutes
Status: INVESTIGATING

Updates coming every 5 minutes..."
```

---

## ✅ 24-HOUR MONITORING PLAN

### Continuous Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor in terminal window
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs -f api | grep -i "error\|warning\|critical"

# Watch Grafana dashboard (every 15 min check)
# - http://localhost:3002

# Check for alerts
# - Error rate spike?
# - Latency increase?
# - Resource exhaustion?
# - Service failures?
```

### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric               | Target | Warning | Critical |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------- | -------- |
| Error Rate           | < 0.1% | > 1%    | > 5%     |
| Response Time (p95)  | < 1.5s | > 2.5s  | > 5s     |
| CPU Usage            | < 50%  | > 70%   | > 90%    |
| Memory Usage         | < 60%  | > 80%   | > 95%    |
| Database Connections | < 50   | > 75    | > 90     |
| Redis Hit Rate       | > 70%  | < 50%   | < 10%    |
| Uptime               | 100%   | < 99.9% | < 99%    |

### Action Items by Severity
