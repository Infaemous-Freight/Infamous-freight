## Workflow Alerts Evidence

Related issue: [MVP]: Add workflow alerts after core flow works

Alert types implemented:

- `quote_request_received` — triggered when a `QuoteRequest` record has `status: pending` or `status: new`.
- `carrier_document_reminder` — triggered when a `RateAgreement` (memory store) or `Document` (Prisma store) has `status: pending`, `status: missing`, or `status: expired`.
- `insurance_expiration_reminder` — triggered when a `RateAgreement` has an `expiryDate` within the next 30 days.
- `stale_load_update` — triggered when a `Load` has an active status (`booked`, `in_transit`, `dispatched`, `at_pickup`, `loaded`, `carrier_assigned`) and no associated `ShipmentTracking` entries.
- `missing_pod_reminder` — triggered when a `ShipmentTracking` entry has `status: delivered` and `podReceived: false`.
- `overdue_invoice` — triggered when a `CarrierPayment` has `status: pending` (memory store) or an `Invoice` is past its `dueDate` without being paid (Prisma store).
- `exception_alert` — triggered when a `Load` or `ShipmentTracking` entry has `status: exception`.

Endpoint: `GET /api/workflows/alerts` (requires `x-tenant-id` and valid `x-user-role` headers).
